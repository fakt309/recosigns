Additional restrictions from the author-----------------
You cannot use the word "premium" in the name of the file with the source code and also indicate the premium level higher than your own.
For example, you cannot name the file "recosigns.premium.js" if you havenâ€™t paid for the premium, and also you cannot use "recosigns.premiumX5.js" if you only paid for X4.
